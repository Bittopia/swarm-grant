# Bittopia University: Swarm Grant
This app was built using the Swarm protocol. We would like to thank the Swarm team and community for supporting us in creating a decentralized autonomous university where knowledge is protected and preserved using P2P and decentralized networks.

## DAC
Imagine if every field of knowledge was able to form its own economy and society, standing on the shoulders of passionate individuals that have contributed to its growth. That is how we have designed the courses at Bittopia University. Each course is decentralized with its own governance and financial system.

## DAS
We have considered the importance of clubs and societies and their role in bringing people together. With the help of decentralized technologies, we can introduce a private and secure space for people to collaborate and share ideas.

## create-svelte

Everything you need to build a Svelte project, powered by [`create-svelte`](https://github.com/sveltejs/kit/tree/master/packages/create-svelte).

## Creating a project

If you're seeing this, you've probably already done this step. Congrats!

```bash
# create a new project in the current directory
npm create svelte@latest

# create a new project in my-app
npm create svelte@latest my-app
```

## Developing

Once you've created a project and installed dependencies with `npm install` (or `pnpm install` or `yarn`), start a development server:

```bash
npm run dev

# or start the server and open the app in a new browser tab
npm run dev -- --open
```

## Building

To create a production version of your app:

```bash
npm run build
```

You can preview the production build with `npm run preview`.

> To deploy your app, you may need to install an [adapter](https://kit.svelte.dev/docs/adapters) for your target environment.
